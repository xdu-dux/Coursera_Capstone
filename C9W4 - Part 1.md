# Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

## Project Title *
## Central business district comparison between Frankfurt and London

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or 
execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a 
problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your __Introduction/Business Problem__ section in your final report. So I recommend that 
you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a 
link to it.
