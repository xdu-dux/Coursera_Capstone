Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the 
Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with 
the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

This submission will eventually become your __Data__ section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having 
your __Data__ section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.
